-----
Creating a ROS Package
-----
'For a package to be considered a catkin package it must meet a few requirements:

    The package must contain a catkin compliant package.xml file.
        That package.xml file provides meta information about the package. 

    The package must contain a CMakeLists.txt which uses catkin.

        If it is a catkin metapackage it must have the relevant boilerplate CMakeLists.txt file. 
    Each package must have its own folder
        This means no nested packages nor multiple packages sharing the same directory. 

The simplest possible package might have a structure which looks like this:

    my_package/
      CMakeLists.txt
      package.xml
'
catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]
#create #create a new package called '<package_name>  which depends on depend1, depend2, and depend3

----
Building a ROS Package
----
#catkin_make is a command line tool which adds some convenience to the standard catkin workflow. You can imagine that 
#catkin_make combines the calls to cmake and make in the standard CMake workflow. 
catkin_make [make_targets] [-DCMAKE_VARIABLES=...]

# In a catkin workspace
catkin_make
catkin_make install  # (optionally)

#The above commands will build any catkin projects found in the src folder. This follows the
#recommendations set by REP128.
#if your source code is in a different place, say my_src then you would call catkin_make like this:

catkin_make --source my_src
catkin_make install --source my_src  # (optionally)

----
ROS Nodes 
----

#A node really isn't much more than an executable file within a ROS package. ROS nodes use a ROS client library 
#to communicate with other nodes. Nodes can publish or subscribe to a Topic. Nodes can also provide or use a Service. 

#rospy = python client library
#roscpp = c++ client library 

#Première chose à run
roscore

#Affiche les nodes active
rosnode list

#rosnode info command returns information about a specific node
rosnode info [La node]

#rosrun allows you to use the package name to directly run a node within a package 
#(without having to know the package path).

rosrun [package_name] [node_name]

#Remapping Argument to change the node's name

rosnode ping my_turtle

Ros topic
---
#rqt_graph creates a dynamic graph of what's going on in the system. rqt_graph is part of the rqt package

sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-rqt
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-rqt-common-plugins

The rostopic tool allows you to get information about ROS topics
rostopic bw     display bandwidth used by topic
rostopic echo   print messages to screen
rostopic hz     display publishing rate of topic    
rostopic list   print information about active topics
rostopic pub    publish data to topic : rostopic pub [topic] [msg_type] [args]
rostopic type   print topic type

Rappel : on peut faire rostopic argument -h pour savoir quel arguments donner

rostopic pub -1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, 1.8]'
Explication :
This command will publish messages to a given topic:

rostopic pub

This option (dash-one) causes rostopic to only publish one message then exit:

 -1 

This is the name of the topic to publish to:

/turtle1/cmd_vel

This is the message type to use when publishing to the topic:

geometry_msgs/Twist

This option (double-dash) tells the option parser that none of the following arguments is an option. This is required in cases where your arguments have a leading dash -, like negative numbers.

--

As noted before, a geometry_msgs/Twist msg has two vectors of three floating point elements each: linear and angular. In this case, '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' becomes the linear value with x=2.0, y=0.0, and z=0.0, and '[0.0, 0.0, 1.8]' is the angular value with x=0.0, y=0.0, and z=1.8. These arguments are actually in YAML syntax, which is described more in the YAML command line documentation.

'[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, 1.8]' 

You may have noticed that the turtle has stopped moving; this is because the turtle requires a steady stream of commands at 1 Hz to keep moving. We can publish a steady stream of commands using rostopic pub -r command:

rostopic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 1 -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, -1.8]'

#rqt_plot displays a scrolling time plot of the data published on topics. Here we'll use rqt_plot 
#to plot the data being published on the /turtle1/pose topic. First, start rqt_plot by typing
rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot

#dd any topic to the plot. Typing /turtle1/pose/x will highlight the plus button, previously disabled

----
Understanding ROS Services and Parameters
----

#rosservice can easily attach to ROS's client/service framework with services. rosservice has many commands 
#that can be used on services ( rosservice list)

rosservice list         print information about active services
rosservice call         call the service with the provided args : rosservice call [service] [args]
rosservice type         print service type
rosservice find         find services by service type
rosservice uri          print service ROSRPC uri

rosparam allows you to store and manipulate data on the ROS Parameter Server. The Parameter Server can store 
integers, floats, boolean, dictionaries, and lists. rosparam uses the YAML markup language for syntax. In 
simple cases, YAML looks very natural: 1 is an integer, 1.0 is a float, one is a string, true is a boolean, 
[1, 2, 3] is a list of integers, and {a: b, c: d} is a dictionary. rosparam has many commands that can be used 
on parameters, as shown below

rosparam set            set parameter
rosparam get            get parameter
rosparam load           load parameters from file
rosparam dump           dump parameters to file
rosparam delete         delete parameter
rosparam list           list parameter names

Publisher Nodes
----

Here's the condensed version of what's going on:

    Initialize the ROS system

    Advertise that we are going to be publishing std_msgs/String messages on the chatter topic to the master

    Loop while publishing messages to chatter 10 times a second 
    
/!\ src/talker.cpp /!\

#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "std_msgs/String.h"

#include <sstream>

/**
 * This tutorial demonstrates simple sending of messages over the ROS system.
 */
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  /**
   * The ros::init() function needs to see argc and argv so that it can perform
   * any ROS arguments and name remapping that were provided at the command line.
   * For programmatic remappings you can use a different version of init() which takes
   * remappings directly, but for most command-line programs, passing argc and argv is
   * the easiest way to do it.  The third argument to init() is the name of the node.
   *
   * You must call one of the versions of ros::init() before using any other
   * part of the ROS system.
   */
  ros::init(argc, argv, "talker");

  /**
   * NodeHandle is the main access point to communications with the ROS system.
   * The first NodeHandle constructed will fully initialize this node, and the last
   * NodeHandle destructed will close down the node.
   */
  ros::NodeHandle n;

  /**
   * The advertise() function is how you tell ROS that you want to
   * publish on a given topic name. This invokes a call to the ROS
   * master node, which keeps a registry of who is publishing and who

   *
   * The second parameter to advertise() is the size of the message queue

   * than we can send them, the number here specifies how many messages to
   * buffer up before throwing some away.
   */
  ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1000);

  ros::Rate loop_rate(10);

  /**
   * A count of how many messages we have sent. This is used to create

     * is the message object. The type of this object must agree with the type

    ros::spinOnce();

    loop_rate.sleep();

---
Subscriber Node
---
Again, here's a condensed version of what's going on:

    Initialize the ROS system

    Subscribe to the chatter topic
    Spin, waiting for messages to arrive

    When a message arrives, the chatterCallback() function is called 
    
src/listener.cpp

#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "std_msgs/String.h"

/**
 * This tutorial demonstrates simple receipt of messages over the ROS system.
 */
void chatterCallback(const std_msgs::String::ConstPtr& msg)
{
  ROS_INFO("I heard: [%s]", msg->data.c_str());
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  /**
   * The ros::init() function needs to see argc and argv so that it can perform
   * any ROS arguments and name remapping that were provided at the command line.
   * For programmatic remappings you can use a different version of init() which takes

   * the easiest way to do it.  The third argument to init() is the name of the node.
   *
   * You must call one of the versions of ros::init() before using any other
   * part of the ROS system.
   */
  ros::init(argc, argv, "listener");

  /**
   * NodeHandle is the main access point to communications with the ROS system.
   * The first NodeHandle constructed will fully initialize this node, and the last
   * NodeHandle destructed will close down the node.
   */
  ros::NodeHandle n;

  /**
   * The subscribe() call is how you tell ROS that you want to receive messages
   * on a given topic.  This invokes a call to the ROS
   * master node, which keeps a registry of who is publishing and who
   * is subscribing.  Messages are passed to a callback function, here
   * called chatterCallback.  subscribe() returns a Subscriber object that you
   * must hold on to until you want to unsubscribe.  When all copies of the Subscriber
   * object go out of scope, this callback will automatically be unsubscribed from
   * this topic.
   *
   * The second parameter to the subscribe() function is the size of the message
   * queue.  If messages are arriving faster than they are being processed, this
   * is the number of messages that will be buffered up before beginning to throw
   * away the oldest ones.
   */
  ros::Subscriber sub = n.subscribe("chatter", 1000, chatterCallback);

  /**
   * ros::spin() will enter a loop, pumping callbacks.  With this version, all
   * callbacks will be called from within this thread (the main one).  ros::spin()
   * will exit when Ctrl-C is pressed, or the node is shutdown by the master.
   */
